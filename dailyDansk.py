# DAILY DANISH PYTHON CODE
"Alright, I forgot how much I liked working with Python. I put together an automated email sender for sending daily Danish translations. I've been trying to jot down Danish words I run into to look up their translations. The script I have running will email daily with a few randomly selected translations"
