#  coding: utf-8
# DAILY DANISH PYTHON CODE
"Alright, I forgot how much I liked working with Python. I put together an automated email sender for sending daily Danish translations. I've been trying to jot down Danish words I run into to look up their translations later. The script I have running will email daily with a few randomly selected translations pulled from a CSV file. Pretty nifty."


# TODO I'm getting an encoding error occasionally "u'\u2013'.encode('utf-8')" might be the solution, but I don't know where to stick that. that's what she said
# TODO Set up chrontab to run programs on the daily 
# TODO Add in the HTML MIME for part2
# TODO Add in dansk ord fra din dansk oversÃ¦tter list
