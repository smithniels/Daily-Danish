# DAILY DANISH PYTHON CODE
"Alright, I think it's been about a whole minute. I forgot how much I liked writing Python! I put together an automated email sender that sends daily Danish translations for words that I've come across. The script I have running will email daily with a few randomly selected translations. >Link to code repo<"

# TODO I don't think all of these imports are being used (encoder/subprocess/ CSV should probably be swapped for pandas)
